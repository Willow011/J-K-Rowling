<p>
    Joanne Rowling was born on 31st July 1965 at Yate General Hospital near Bristol, and grew up in 
    <br>
    Gloucestershire in England and in Chepstow, Gwent, in south-east Wales.
    <br>
    Her father, Peter, was an aircraft engineer at the Rolls Royce factory in Bristol and her mother,
    <br> 
    Anne, was a science technician in the Chemistry department at Wyedean Comprehensive, where Jo herself
    <br> 
    went to school. Anne was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when Jo was a teenager and died in 1990,
    <br> 
    before the Harry Potter books were published.  Jo also has a younger sister, Di.
    <br>
    The young Jo grew up surrounded by books. “I lived for books," she has said. “I was your basic
    <br> 
    common-or-garden bookworm, complete with freckles and National Health spectacles.”
